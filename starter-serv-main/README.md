# Project Starter Setup with .NET Core Web API

This project is a starter setup for building a .NET Core Web API application. It provides a foundation with essential features and components to kickstart your development process. The following features are included:

- **PostgreSQL DB Connection**: Configure the application to connect to a PostgreSQL database, allowing you to store and retrieve data efficiently.

- **CRUD API**: Set up a complete set of RESTful endpoints for performing CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on various resources.

- **Upload Image**: Implement functionality to handle image uploads, enabling users to upload and store images in the application.

- **Cron Job Automation**: Utilize cron job scheduling to automate tasks within your application, such as data synchronization, sending notifications, or performing routine operations at specific intervals.

- **Helper Functions**: Includes a set of helper functions to facilitate common operations and enhance development productivity.

- **Application Constants**: Define application-wide constants for easy configuration and centralized management of key values.

- **Logging to File**: Configure logging to file, allowing you to capture and analyze application logs for debugging and monitoring purposes.

- **Model Generator**: Utilize a model generator tool that simplifies the process of generating models from existing database schemas, saving you time and effort.

- **Using Entity Framework Core**: Leverage the power of Entity Framework Core, a popular object-relational mapping (ORM) framework, to interact with the database and streamline data access operations.

- **JWT Bearer Login**: Implement JWT (JSON Web Token) bearer authentication for secure user login and API authorization.

- **Swagger**: Incorporate Swagger UI, a powerful tool for documenting and testing APIs, making it easier for developers to understand and interact with your API endpoints.

This project starter setup aims to provide a solid foundation for building .NET Core Web API applications, allowing you to focus on your business logic while taking advantage of preconfigured features and components. Feel free to customize and extend this setup to suit your specific project requirements. Happy coding!
